# Synaptic Slack Bot v2 - Multi-Provider AI Slack Bot

## Project Overview

Synaptic Slack Bot v2 is an intelligent Slack bot that connects your team's conversations with powerful AI capabilities. It serves as a bridge between your Slack workspace and various AI models, allowing seamless access to AI assistance without leaving your communication platform.

The bot leverages OpenRouter as a gateway to multiple AI service providers (including OpenAI, Anthropic, and others) and can make function calls to an MCP server to perform custom actions based on user requests.

## What's New in v2

Version 2 of Synaptic Slack Bot v2 introduces significant enhancements:

- **Expanded Slack Permissions**: Utilizes a comprehensive set of Slack permissions to perform a wide range of actions
- **Modular Feature Architecture**: Organized features into separate modules for better maintainability
- **Enhanced Conversational Experience**: Improved response handling for both action requests and conversational queries
- **Intelligent Response Formatting**: Automatically determines when to use function calls vs. direct responses
- **User-Friendly Action Responses**: Provides clear, conversational confirmations when actions are performed
- **Comprehensive Slack API Integration**: Implements all major Slack API endpoints for maximum flexibility
- **Slack-Native Formatting**: Ensures all responses use Slack's formatting syntax for optimal readability
- **Token Usage Optimization**: Implements smart strategies to minimize token usage and reduce costs
- **Advanced Function Chaining**: Seamlessly executes multi-step workflows with intelligent function sequencing

### Latest Updates (v2.1)

The latest update includes significant improvements to function chaining and Slack formatting:

- **Enhanced Multi-step Workflow Detection**: Better recognition of complex user requests that require multiple actions
- **Improved Function Chaining**: Fixed issues with sequential function execution for tasks like creating channels and sending welcome messages
- **Comprehensive Workflow Analysis**: Smarter analysis of user requests to determine all required functions for multi-step tasks
- **Strict Slack Formatting Compliance**: Strengthened formatting rules to ensure all responses use proper Slack markup
- **Expanded Context Preservation**: Better preservation of original request context in multi-step workflows

### Token Usage Optimization

The bot includes several optimizations to minimize token usage and improve cost efficiency:

- **Selective Function Filtering**: Only sends relevant functions based on the user's prompt, rather than sending all function definitions with every request
- **Minimal Conversation History**: Only includes essential messages (system message and current user message) in the conversation context
- **Concise System Messages**: Uses compact system messages that maintain essential instructions while reducing token count
- **Smart Function Selection for Multi-step Tasks**: Intelligently selects only the most relevant functions for follow-up requests (e.g., only including sendMessage after searchChannels)
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Extracts and passes only essential information from function results to reduce token usage in multi-step workflows
- **Intelligent Function Bundling**: Groups related functions for common workflows while maintaining token efficiency

These optimizations significantly reduce token consumption, especially for complex multi-step workflows like creating meeting summaries or setting up new channels with welcome messages, while maintaining full functionality.

### New Slack Capabilities

The bot now supports:
- Creating and managing channels
- Sending messages to channels and users
- Uploading and managing files
- Adding reactions to messages
- Setting reminders
- Searching messages and channels
- Managing users and workspace
- Working with bookmarks
- Scheduling messages
- Getting message permalinks
- And more!

### Slack API Endpoints

The bot implements a comprehensive set of Slack API endpoints:

| Category                   | Endpoint                        | Purpose                                              |

### Slack-Native Formatting

The bot ensures all responses use Slack's native formatting syntax rather than Markdown:

- *bold text* (single asterisks) for emphasis
- _italic text_ for definitions
- ~strikethrough~ when needed
- `code snippets` for technical terms
- â€¢ Manual bullet points
- <URL|text> for links with custom text
- >text for quotes or important callouts

This ensures optimal readability and consistent formatting in Slack messages.

## Why Synaptic Slack Bot v2?

Traditional AI assistants often require users to switch contexts, leaving their workflow to access AI capabilities. Synaptic Slack Bot v2 brings AI directly into your team's communication flow, enabling:

- **Instant AI assistance** within Slack threads and channels
- **Consistent AI access** across the organization with shared context
- **Custom actions** through function calling to integrate with your tools
- **Flexible model selection** to optimize for cost, speed, or capabilities

## Use Cases

- **Workspace Management**: Create channels, invite users, and manage Slack workspace directly
- **Knowledge Base Queries**: Ask questions about company documentation, policies, or technical information
- **Content Generation**: Create drafts, summaries, or creative content directly in Slack
- **Data Analysis**: Request analysis of data shared in conversations
- **Custom Workflows**: Trigger specific actions in your systems through function calling
- **Meeting Summaries**: Generate concise summaries of meeting transcripts shared in Slack
- **Code Assistance**: Get help with coding problems or generate code snippets

## Features

- Integration with Slack's API using Bolt framework
- Support for multiple AI providers through OpenRouter
- Function calling capabilities with MCP server
- Conversation context management for coherent multi-turn interactions
- Rich message formatting with Block Kit
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Configurable model selection based on task requirements
- HTTP API endpoint for external automation tools

## HTTP API for Automation

Synaptic Slack Bot v2 now includes an HTTP API endpoint that allows external automation tools like n8n to send natural language instructions to the bot. The bot processes these instructions just like it would process messages in Slack, executing functions and returning results.

Key features of the HTTP API:

- **Simple Integration**: Send natural language instructions via HTTP POST requests
- **Authentication**: Secure API key authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Detailed Responses**: Structured JSON responses with function results
- **n8n Integration**: Easy integration with n8n workflows

Example API request:

```http
POST /api/process-message
Content-Type: application/json
X-API-Key: your-api-key-here

{
  "message": "Create a channel called project-discussion, invite @user1 and @user2, and send a welcome message"
}
```

For detailed API documentation, see the [API.md](API.md) file.

## Technical Architecture

Synaptic Slack Bot v2 is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns and allows for easy extension:

1. **Slack Integration Layer**: Handles all communication with the Slack API
2. **Feature Modules**: Implements specific Slack capabilities (channels, messages, files, etc.)
3. **AI Provider Layer**: Manages connections to AI services through OpenRouter
4. **AI Actions Layer**: Provides a "brains" layer for understanding and executing user requests
5. **Context Management**: Maintains conversation history for coherent interactions
6. **Function Calling System**: Enables the AI to trigger specific actions in your systems
7. **Configuration Layer**: Provides flexible configuration options
